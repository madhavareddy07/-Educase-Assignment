# React JS Assignment Reference Document

## Objective

Create a pixel-perfect React JS application based on the provided Adobe XD design, ensuring a clean, well-formatted codebase. The application should feature a centered mobile app interface on the webpage with seamless and efficient navigation between pages. The final project must be hosted on a platform like Vercel, and the code should be shared via a public GitHub repository.

## Requirements

### 1. Design Implementation

- **Design Source**: Use the Adobe XD design provided at https://xd.adobe.com/view/b68eea25-003d-4a5d-8fdd-d463eeb20b32-e3dd.
- **Pixel-Perfect Design**: The implemented interface must match the Adobe XD design exactly in terms of layout, colors, typography, spacing, and other visual elements.
- **Mobile App Interface**:
    - The mobile app interface should be centered on the webpage.
    - Ensure the design is responsive, maintaining the mobile app appearance as per the Adobe XD prototype, even on larger screens.
- **Navigation**: Implement smooth and efficient navigation between pages as defined in the Adobe XD design, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### 2. Technical Requirements

- **Framework**: Use React JS to build the application.
- **Code Quality**:
    - Write clean, well-structured, and well-commented code.
    - Follow consistent formatting (e.g., use Prettier or ESLint for code formatting).
    - Organize the codebase using a modular structure (e.g., separate components, styles, and utilities).
- **Styling**:
    - Use modern CSS techniques (e.g., CSS-in-JS, styled-components, or Tailwind CSS) for styling.
    - Ensure the styling matches the Adobe XD design precisely.
- **Dependencies**:
    - Use CDN-hosted React and related dependencies (e.g., React, ReactDOM) from a reliable source like `cdn.jsdelivr.net`.
    - Optionally use Babel for JSX support.
- **Form Handling**:
    - Avoid using `<form>` elements with `onSubmit` due to sandbox restrictions. Use alternative methods like button click handlers for form submissions.
    - Use `className` instead of `class` for JSX attributes.

### 3. Hosting and Submission

- **GitHub Repository**:
    - Create a public GitHub repository to host the project code.
    - Ensure the repository includes a clear `README.md` with instructions for running the project locally.
    - Commit code frequently with meaningful commit messages.
- **Hosting**:
    - Deploy the application on a hosting platform such as Vercel, Netlify, or a similar service.
    - Ensure the hosted application is accessible and functional.
- **Deliverables**:
    - Share the link to the public GitHub repository.
    - Share the hosted application link (e.g., Vercel or Netlify URL).

### 4. Additional Notes

- **Adobe XD Context**: Adobe XD is currently in maintenance mode, but the provided design link should be accessible for viewing the prototype.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure the application works in all modern browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- **Performance**: Optimize the application for fast loading and smooth interactions.
- **Documentation**: Include comments in the code to explain key components or logic, and document any setup or deployment steps in the `README.md`.

### 5. Evaluation Criteria

- **Design Fidelity**: How closely the implementation matches the Adobe XD design.
- **Code Quality**: Cleanliness, modularity, and readability of the codebase.
- **Functionality**: Seamless navigation and functionality of the application.
- **Deployment**: Successful hosting and accessibility of the deployed application.
- **Repository**: Organization and documentation in the GitHub repository.

## Submission Instructions

- Submit the following:
    - **GitHub Repository Link**: A public GitHub repository containing the complete codebase.
    - **Hosted Application Link**: A URL to the deployed application on Vercel, Netlify, or a similar platform.
- Ensure both links are functional and accessible before submission.
